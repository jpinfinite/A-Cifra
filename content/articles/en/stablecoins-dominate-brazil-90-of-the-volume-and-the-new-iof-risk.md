[Stablecoins](/artigo/stablecoins-dominan-brasil-90-del-volumen-y-el-nuevo-riesgo-del-iof "Stablecoins dominan Brasil: 90% del volumen y el nuevo riesgo del IOF") Dominate Brazil: 90% of Volume and the New Risk of IOF

The Brazilian discovered the perfect refuge against inflation and volatility: **[Stablecoins](/artigo/stablecoins-brasil-dominio-risco-iof-2026 "Stablecoins Dominam o Brasil: 90% do Volume e o Novo Risco do IOF")**. Recent data from December 2025 shows that dollar-paired coins (such as USDT and USDC) already represent an impressive **90% of all cryptocurrency trading volume in the country**.

But this resounding success caught the attention of the regulator. The Central Bank published the **Resolution BCB nº 521**, which brings new security guidelines, but also opens the door to a charge that nobody wanted: the IOF (Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras).

## Why We Love Stablecoins?

The answer is simple: **Accessible Dollarization**.
In the past, having exposure to the dollar required international accounts, high fees, and bureaucracy. Today, anyone with a cell phone can buy USDT (Tether) in seconds.
*   **Protection:** Shield against Real devaluation.
*   **Agility:** Instant international payments without going through the SWIFT system.
*   **Liquidity:** Easy entry and exit from [bitcoin](#bitcoin) positions.

## The Resolution 521 and the IOF Ghost

The new resolution aims primarily to increase cyber security and prevent money laundering. However, experts point out that classifying stablecoins as "financial assets" subject to exchange may attract IOF (1.1% or more) from [2026](/artigo/sec-innovation-exemption-2026-whats-changing-and-how-to-prepare "SEC Innovation Exemption 2026: What's Changing and How to Prepare").

### What May Change?
1.  **Transfer Cost:** Transferring stablecoins to foreign wallets may become more expensive if the government considers it a "dividend exit."
2.  **National Exchanges:** Brazilian exchanges will have to adapt to much stricter capital and compliance rules, similar to banks.

## Will the Market Come to a Standstill?

Probably not. The efficiency of stablecoins is unbeatable. Even with a potential IOF tax, the speed and utility of the "digital dollar" surpass traditional banking alternatives.

> **Tip:** If you use stablecoins for value storage, stay informed about the Receita Federal's regulations. Transparency is the price of mass adoption.

**Conclusion**

The dominance of stablecoins proves that the Brazilian wants a strong currency. [Regulation](/artigo/drex-and-crypto-regulation-2026-what-changes-for-the-brazilian-investor "Drex and Crypto Regulation 2026: What Changes for the Brazilian Investor?") is inevitable, but it shouldn't kill innovation. 2026 will be the year to test the resilience of this market against the taxman.
