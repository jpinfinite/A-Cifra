Security of Cryptocurrencies is Fundamental for Any Investor in the Crypto Market

With the increase in hacks, scams, and attacks, knowing how to properly protect your digital assets can be the difference between preserving and losing your investments.

This comprehensive guide presents the best practices, tools, and strategies to keep your cryptocurrencies secure against all known threats.

Types of Wallets and Security

Hardware Wallets (Cold Storage)

Hardware wallets are considered the most secure way to store cryptocurrencies:

For daily use, software wallets offer convenience:

* MetaMask: Best for DeFi and Ethereum
* Trust Wallet: Mobile, multi-chain support
* Exodus: Beautiful interface, exchange integrated

Backup and Recovery of Seeds

The seed phrase is your master key - losing it means losing permanent access to your funds.

Best Practices for Seeds

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA adds an extra layer of security to all your accounts:

* Authenticator Apps: Google Authenticator, Authy
* Hardware Keys: YubiKey, Titan Security Key
* SMS: Less secure, avoid when possible
* Biometry: Fingerprint, facial recognition

Security on Exchanges

When using exchanges, follow these security practices:

* Choose Exchange: Reputation, regulation, security
* Exchange Settings: 2FA required, whitelist addresses, limits on withdrawals, notifications

Advanced Security Strategies

	+ 2-of-3: 2 signatures of 3 possible
	+ 3-of-5: For organizations
	+ Gnosis Safe: User-friendly interface for MultiSig
	+ Casa: MultiSig custody service
* Segregation of Funds
	+ Hot Wallet: 5-10% for daily use
	+ Warm Wallet: 20-30% for trading
	+ Cold Storage: 60-75% for holding
	+ DeFi: Only necessary for yield farming
