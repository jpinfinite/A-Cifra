## Step 7: Investment Strategies

### 1. DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)

**What it is:** Invest fixed amount regularly, regardless of price.

- Buy more when price is low
- Buy less when price is high
- **Result:** Balanced average price

**Advantages:**

**What it is:** Buy and hold for long term (1-5 years).

**Strategy:**

**Ideal for:** Investors who believe in crypto's future.

- 35% Promising altcoins
- 10% New projects/memecoins

### 4. Periodic Rebalancing

**Every 3-6 months:**
1. Evaluate performance of each asset
2. Partially sell those that appreciated a lot
3. Buy more of those that fell (if still believe)
4. Maintain portfolio proportions

## Step 8: Avoid Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistakes Beginners Make

6. **Falling for scams**

3. **Trading Volume** - Liquidity and interest

- What timeframe? (1 year, 5 years, 10 years)
- How much do you want to accumulate?
- What risk do you accept?

### Exit Strategy
