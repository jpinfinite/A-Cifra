Avalanche: Subnets and Blockchain Scalability

The Avalanche is a high-performance blockchain platform that offers extreme scalability, low fees, and customizable subnets for specific use cases.

What is Avalanche?

Avalanche is a smart contract platform that processes up to 4,500 transactions per second with finality in less than 2 seconds.

Key Features
- **Speed**: Sub-second finality
- **Scalability**: Thousands of TPS
- **Low Cost**: Cent-penny fees
- **Eco-Friendly**: Efficient Proof of Stake

Unique Architecture

Avalanche uses a three-chain architecture:

X-Chain (Exchange Chain)
- Creation and exchange of assets
- AVAX transactions
- High-speed

C-Chain (Contract Chain)
- Smart contracts
- Compatible with EVM
- DeFi and dApps

P-Chain (Platform Chain)
- Validator coordination
- Subnet creation
- Staking

Avalanche Consensus

The consensus protocol is revolutionary:

How it Works
1. Validator proposes transaction
2. Random sample of validators votes
3. Process repeats until consensus
4. Finality achieved quickly

Advantages
- **Fast**: Confirmation in seconds
- **Secure**: Resistant to attacks
- **Scalable**: Does not degrade with growth
- **Efficient**: Low energy consumption

Subnets: The Differential

Subnets are customizable blockchains within Avalanche:

What are Subnets?
- Independent blockchain networks
- Custom rules and validators
- Connected to Avalanche

Advantages
- **Customization**: Specific rules
- **Privacy**: Private subnets possible
- **Scalability**: Each subnet is independent
- **Compliance**: Meets specific regulations

Use Cases
- **Gaming**: Subnets for specific games
- **Business**: Corporate blockchains
- **DeFi**: Specialized protocols
- **Governments**: Public applications

The AVAX Token

AVAX is the native token with multiple functions:

Payment of Fees
- Gas fees on the three chains
- Very low fees

Staking
- Validators stake a minimum of 2,000 AVAX
- Delegators can stake any amount
- Rewards of 8-11% per year

Creation of Subnets
- Required to create subnets
- Tokens are burned
- Reduces circulating supply

Avalanche Ecosystem

DeFi
