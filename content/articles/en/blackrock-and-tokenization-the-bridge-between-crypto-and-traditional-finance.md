**[BlackRock](/artigo/blackrock-tokenizacao-ponte-cripto-financas-tradicionais "BlackRock e Tokenização: A Ponte Entre Cripto e Finanças Tradicionais") and Tokenization: Bridging Crypto and Traditional Finance**

[BlackRock](/artigo/blackrock-y-tokenizacin-el-puente-entre-cripto-y-finanzas-tradicionales "BlackRock y Tokenización: El Puente Entre Cripto y Finanzas Tradicionales"), the world's largest asset manager with $10 trillion under management, is leading a silent revolution that may transform the global financial system: the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). In 2025, the company not only adopted blockchain technology but is actively building a bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi).

**What is Tokenization?**

Tokenization is the process of converting ownership rights of a real-world [asset](/artigo/asset-tokenization-rwa-2026-maximize-your-gains-with-security "Asset Tokenization RWA 2026: Maximize Your Gains with Security") (such as properties, stocks, bonds, commodities) into digital tokens on a blockchain. Each token represents a fraction of the underlying asset and can be traded, transferred, or used as collateral.

**How Does Tokenization Work?**

The tokenization process:

1. Real-world asset (e.g., a $10 million building)
2. Legal structuring (SPV, trust, etc.)
3. Token issuance (10 million tokens at $1 each)
4. Registration on blockchain ([ethereum](/artigo/staking-ethereum-guia-renda-passiva-2026), Polygon, etc.)
5. Distribution (sale to investors)
6. Secondary market trading (exchanges, DEXs)

**Advantages of Tokenization**

1. Fractionation: Expensive assets become accessible
2. Liquidity: Illiquid assets become liquid
3. Transparency: Ownership registered on blockchain
4. Efficiency: Lower transaction costs
5. Programmability: Smart contracts automate processes
