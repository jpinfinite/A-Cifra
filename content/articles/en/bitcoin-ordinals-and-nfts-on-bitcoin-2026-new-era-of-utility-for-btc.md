Ordinals and NFTs on [Bitcoin](/artigo/bitcoin-ordinals-nfts-bitcoin-2026 "Bitcoin Ordinals e NFTs no Bitcoin 2026: Nova Era de Utilidade para BTC") 2026: A New Era of Utility for BTC

[Bitcoin](/artigo/bitcoin-ordinals-y-nfts-en-bitcoin-2026-nueva-era-de-utilidad-para-btc "Bitcoin Ordinals y NFTs en Bitcoin 2026: Nueva Era de Utilidad para BTC") is no longer just "digital gold." In 2026, Ordinals, BRC-20, and Runes have transformed the world's most secure blockchain into a vibrant platform for NFTs, tokens, and applications. Discover how this revolution is happening.

What Are Bitcoin Ordinals?

The Innovation of Casey Rodarmor

January 2023: Casey Rodarmor launches Ordinals
Concept: Numbering each satoshi (smallest unit of [Bitcoin](/artigo/bitcoin-100k-analise-completa-caminho-2025 "Bitcoin Rumo aos Bitcoin00K: Análise Completa dos 4 Fatores que Vão Determinar o Próximo Movimento")) and inscribing data on it

How it Works:
1. Each satoshi receives a unique number (ordinal)
2. Data (image, text, code) is "inscribed" on the satoshi
3. Satoshi becomes a native NFT on Bitcoin
4. No smart contracts, no sidechains - all on-chain

Why It's Revolutionary?

Before Ordinals:
- NFTs only on Ethereum, Solana, etc.
- Bitcoin seen only as money
- Limited utility

After Ordinals:
- NFTs on the most secure blockchain
- Bitcoin with expanded utility
- New economy on Bitcoin
- Demand for block space

Types of Inscriptions

1. Images (Traditional NFTs)

Famous Collections:
- Bitcoin Punks: First 100 Ordinals
- Ordinal Maxi Biz (OMB): Iconic collection
- Bitcoin Frogs: 10,000 pixelated frogs
- NodeMonkes: Monkeys on Bitcoin

Features:
- Totally on-chain (no IPFS)
- Immutable
- Bitcoin security
- Real scarcity

2. Text and Code

Uses:
- Poems and literature
- Program code
- Historical messages
- Scientific data

Example:
Inscription #0: "gm" (good morning) - first inscription in history

3. Audio and Video

Possibilities:
- Complete songs
- Video clips
- Podcasts
- Short films

Limitation:
- Block size (4MB) limits duration

4. Games

Games entirely on-chain:
- Doom on Bitcoin
- HTML5 games
- Emulators

Advantage:
- Eternal preservation - as long as Bitcoin exists, the game exists

BRC-20: Tokens on Bitcoin

What Are BRC-20?

March 2023: Domo launches BRC-20 standard
Concept: Fungible tokens using Ordinals

How it Works:
1. JSON inscription defines token (name, supply, etc.)
2. Subsequent inscriptions mint tokens
3. Transfers via inscriptions
4. All tracked off-chain by indexers

Example inscription:
```json
{
  "p": "brc-20",
  "op": "deploy",
  "tick": "ordi",
  "max": "21000000",
  "lim": "1000"
}
```

Main BRC-20 Tokens

1. ORDI
- First BRC-20 token
- Market cap: $1+ billion (peak)
- Symbol of innovation

2. SATS
- Tribute to satoshi
- Supply: 2.1 quadrillion
- Strong community

3. RATS
- Community experiment
- Fair launch
- Meme token

4. PIZA
- Reference to Bitcoin Pizza Day
- Cultural Bitcoin

Limitations of BRC-20

Problems:
- No smart contracts
- Complex transfers
- Centralized indexers
- Poor UX

Solution:
- Runes (next section)

Runes: Evolution of Tokens on Bitcoin

What Are Runes?

Creator: Casey Rodarmor (same as Ordinals)
Launch: April 2024 (Bitcoin halving)
Objective: Native, efficient fungible tokens

Advantages over BRC-20

Efficiency:
- Uses UTXO model (native to Bitcoin)
- Less data on-chain
- Lower fees
- Faster

Simplicity:
- No indexers needed
- On-chain verification
- Less complexity

Compatibility:
- Works with existing Bitcoin wallets
- No protocol changes needed
- More decentralized

How Runes Work

Protocol:
1. Rune is created in a special transaction
2. Tokens are represented in UTXOs
3. Transfers are regular Bitcoin transactions
4. All verifiable on-chain

Example:
- You have 100 RUNE tokens
- They are in a UTXO
- You send 50 to someone
- Creates 2 UTXOs: 50 for recipient, 50 in change

Impact on Bitcoin

Demand for Block Space

Before Ordinals:
- Partially empty blocks

- High fees in peaks
- Extra revenue for miners

Numbers:

Security of the Network

Benefit:
- More fees = more security
- Less dependence on block subsidy
- Long-term sustainability

Criticism:
- Common users pay more
- Network congestion
- Debate about "spam"

Community Debate

Purists:
- Bitcoin is money, not a platform for NFTs
- Ordinals are "spam"
- Should be blocked

Pragmatists:
- Market decides
- Fees benefit security
- Innovation is good

Result in 2026:
Consensus that Ordinals are here to stay. Market adapts.
