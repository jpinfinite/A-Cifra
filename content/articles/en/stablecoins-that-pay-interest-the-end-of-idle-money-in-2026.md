Stablecoins that Pay Interest: The End of Idle Money in 2026

The Revolution of Interest-Bearing Stablecoins: A New Chapter for Digital Economy

2025-2026: The Year of Transition to a No-End Economy

The 2020 decade was marked by a series of events that transformed the way people think about money and economy. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital technologies, including cryptocurrencies and mobile payment apps. The perception that physical money was an obstacle to mobility and economic efficiency began to change. In 2025, the digital economy is ready to take the next step: creating a no-end financial system.

The Pain of the Market: Idle Money and Inflation

One of the main problems of the traditional financial market is the existence of idle money. This occurs when money is deposited in bank accounts and not used for investments or consumption. According to estimates, about 70% of circulating money is idle in bank accounts. Additionally, inflation is a continuous problem, reducing the value of money over time. The combination of these two factors creates a situation where money is not effectively used to generate value.

The Solution: Interest-Bearing Stablecoins

The technology of interest-bearing stablecoins is a direct response to the pain of the market. These types of cryptocurrencies are designed to maintain a stable value in relation to a reference currency, such as the US dollar. Additionally, they offer interest to investors, encouraging them to keep their money in motion. This creates a virtuous cycle where money is used to generate value, reducing inflation and increasing economic efficiency.

The Explosion of Interest-Bearing Stablecoins in 2026

In 2026, the technology of interest-bearing stablecoins will be ready to explode. With the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies and mobile payment apps, the demand for interest-bearing stablecoins will increase significantly. Additionally, the competition between different types of stablecoins will be intense, leading to continuous improvement of technology and services offered. The combination of these factors will create a vibrant and profitable market for interest-bearing stablecoins, revolutionizing the way people think about money and economy.

Yield-Bearing Stablecoins: A Technical and Financial Depth

Introduction

Stablecoins are a class of cryptocurrencies that seek to maintain a fixed value in relation to a reference currency, such as the US dollar. However, with the rise of yield-bearing stablecoins, the dynamics have changed. In this article, we will dive into the technology behind these new actors and explore how they work.

What are Yield-Bearing Stablecoins?

Yield-bearing stablecoins are a class of stablecoins that offer a yield to investors who hold them. This means that, instead of just maintaining a fixed value, these stablecoins also generate income for their holders. It's like having a deposit in a traditional bank account, but with the advantage of being able to use your money as a means of payment.

How does it work "under the hood"?

Yield-bearing stablecoins work based on a combination of technologies, including:

* Reserve assets: Yield-bearing stablecoins maintain a reserve of assets in a reference currency, such as the US dollar. This ensures that the value of the stablecoin is maintained.
* Loans: Yield-bearing stablecoins lend part of their reserve assets to other investors, offering a yield.
* Interest rate: The interest rate is calculated based on the yield offered by the loans and is distributed to the holders of the stablecoin.
* Governance protocol: Yield-bearing stablecoins usually have a governance protocol that allows holders to vote on important decisions, such as the interest rate and reserve assets.

Key differences from previous technologies

Yield-bearing stablecoins present some key differences from previous technologies, including:

* Interest rate: Yield-bearing stablecoins offer an interest rate, which is not common in traditional stablecoins.
* Reserve assets: Yield-bearing stablecoins maintain a reserve of assets, which ensures that the value of the stablecoin is maintained.
* Governance protocol: Yield-bearing stablecoins usually have a governance protocol that allows holders to vote on important decisions.

Smart analogies

Yield-bearing stablecoins can be compared to:

* Deposits in a traditional bank account: Yield-bearing stablecoins offer an interest rate, which is similar to a deposit in a traditional bank account.
* Investments in stocks: Yield-bearing stablecoins can be seen as investments in stocks, as they offer a yield and a potential for growth.
* Gold: Yield-bearing stablecoins can be compared to gold, as they offer a reserve of assets and a value that is maintained over time.

Conclusion

Yield-bearing stablecoins are a class of cryptocurrencies that offer an interest rate and a reserve of assets. They work based on a combination of technologies, including reserve assets, loans, and a governance protocol. Yield-bearing stablecoins present some key differences from previous technologies and can be compared to deposits in traditional bank accounts, investments in stocks, and gold.
