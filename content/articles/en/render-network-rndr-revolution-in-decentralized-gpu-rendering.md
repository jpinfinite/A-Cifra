# Render Network (RNDR): Revolutionizing Decentralized GPU Rendering

The **[Render](/artigo/render-network-rndr-revolucin-en-renderizacin-gpu-descentralizada "Render Network (RNDR): Revolución en Renderización GPU Descentralizada") Network** is transforming the creative industry by democratizing access to GPU computational power through a decentralized blockchain-based network.

## The Problem that Render Network Solves

High-quality 3D rendering is extremely resource-intensive. Professionals face:

**Prohibitive Costs:**
- Professional GPUs cost $5,000-$50,000
- Need for multiple GPUs
- Rapid depreciation
- High energy costs

**Excessive Time:**
- Frames take hours to render
- Complete projects take weeks
- Difficult deadlines to meet

**Wasted Capacity:**
- GPUs are idle 60-80% of the time
- Underutilized investment
- No monetization of unused capacity

## How it Works

[Render](/artigo/render-network-gpu-descentralizada "Render Network (RNDR): Revolução na Renderização GPU Descentralizada") Network creates a decentralized marketplace:

1. **Artists** submit rendering jobs
2. **Nodes** with GPUs process rendering
3. **Automatic Payment** in RNDR tokens
4. **Verified Final Result** delivery

### Technology

**Proof of Render:**
- Cryptographic verification of work
- Automatic fraud detection
- On-chain reputation system

**Blockchain Solana:**
- Fast and cheap transactions
- Smart contracts for escrow
- Decentralized governance

## RNDR Token

**Utility:**
- Payment for rendering
- [Staking](/artigo/staking-ethereum-guia-renda-passiva-2026) of nodes
- Governance of the network
- Premium access

**Tokenomics:**
- Total Supply: 536M RNDR
- 0.5% burn per transaction
- Deflationary model
