Grayscale Launches [Zcash](/artigo/zcash-grayscale-etf---regulated-privacy-or-just-a-name "Zcash Grayscale ETF - Regulated Privacy or Just a Name?") ETF - Regulated Privacy or Just a Name?

November 30, 2025 - [Grayscale](/artigo/grayscale-etf-de-zcash---privacidad-regulada-o-solo-en-el-nombre "Grayscale ETF de Zcash - Privacidad Regulada o Solo en el Nombre?") Investments has just launched the first Zcash (ZEC) ETF in the United States, marking a historic moment for privacy coins. However, the crypto community is divided: is regulated privacy still privacy?

What is the Grayscale Zcash Trust (ZCSH)?

[Grayscale](/artigo/grayscale-zcash-etf-privacidade-regulada-2025 "Grayscale ETF de Zcash - Privacidade Regulada ou Apenas no Nome?") Zcash Trust (ZCSH) is the first regulated investment product focused on a privacy coin in the US.

Product details:

- Ticker: ZCSH
- Management fee: 2.5% per year
- Minimum investment: $25,000
- Available for: Accredited investors
- Custody: Coinbase Custody

What does this mean? Institutional and qualified investors can have exposure to [Zcash](/artigo/zcash-etf-can-privacy-coins-be-approved-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-the-grayscale-application "Zcash ETF: Can Privacy Coins Be Approved? A Comprehensive Analysis of the Grayscale Application") without having to buy and hold the cryptocurrency directly.

What is Zcash?

Zcash (ZEC) is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency launched in 2016.

Key features:

- zk-SNARKs: Zero-knowledge proofs that enable private transactions
- Optional transactions: Can choose between transparent (like Bitcoin) or private (shielded)
- Auditable: Despite the privacy, it is possible to prove compliance when necessary

Difference from Bitcoin:

- Bitcoin: All transactions are public on the blockchain
- Zcash: Transactions can be completely private (addresses, values, metadata)

Use cases:

- Financial privacy protection
- Companies that do not want to expose transactions
- Individuals in countries with financial censorship
- Protection against corporate surveillance

Why is this historic?

1. First Regulated Privacy Coin

Until now, privacy coins were seen as "unregulable" by the SEC.

Reason: Concerns about money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion.

Change: Grayscale convinced the SEC that Zcash can be regulated while maintaining privacy.

How: Custody in a regulated exchange (Coinbase), KYC/AML rigorous for investors, transparency in fund management, and audit of reserves.

2. Legitimization of Privacy Coins

Impact: If the SEC approved a Zcash ETF, it legitimates privacy coins as a class of assets.

Consequences:

- Other ETFs of privacy coins may come (Monero, Dash?)
- Exchanges may relist privacy coins
- Institutions may invest without regulatory fear

3. Legal Precedent

Importance: This ETF establishes a precedent that privacy ≠ illegality.

Argument from Grayscale: "Financial privacy is a fundamental right. Just as you don't want your bank to disclose your balance, crypto investors deserve privacy."

The Debate: Does Regulated Privacy Work?

Arguments in favor:

1. Privacy for Legitimate Investors

Even with KYC, your Zcash transactions remain private on the blockchain.

Example: You buy ZCSH through Grayscale, Grayscale buys ZEC on the market, your ZEC transactions are private (shielded), and no one can track your on-chain movements.

2. Protection Against Corporate Surveillance

Companies like Chainalysis cannot track Zcash private transactions.

3. Compliance When Necessary

Zcash allows "viewing keys" - you can prove your transactions to auditors without exposing everything publicly.

Arguments against:

1. KYC Defeats the Purpose

Criticism: If you need to do KYC to buy the ETF, the government already knows you have Zcash.

Response from critics: "Regulated privacy is an oxymoron. If the government knows you have it, it's not private."

2. Centralized Custody

Problem: Grayscale holds the ZEC in Coinbase, not in private wallets.

Risk: Coinbase can be hacked, the government can confiscate, and it's not "your" Zcash in reality.

3. Only for the Rich

Minimum: $25,000 + being an accredited investor

Result: Privacy is only for those who can pay.

Impact on Zcash Price

Immediate Reaction:

- ZEC price: $42 before the announcement, $58 after the announcement (+38%), and $52 currently (consolidating)
- Volume: Increased 300% in the first 24 hours

Projections:

- Bullish analysts: $80-$100 by Q1 2026

Reason: Institutional demand via ETF, regulatory legitimation, and possible listing on more exchanges

- Bearish analysts: $35-$45 (return to normal)

Reason: Hype is temporary, minimum of $25K limits demand, and competition from Monero and other privacy coins.

Comparison with Other ETFs

| ETF | Fee | Minimum | Status |
|-----|------|--------|--------|
| Grayscale Bitcoin (GBTC) | 1.5% | $0 | Public |
| Grayscale Ethereum (ETHE) | 2.5% | $0 | Public |
| Grayscale Zcash (ZCSH) | 2.5% | $25K | Accredited |
| Grayscale Monero | - | - | Non-existent |

Observation: ZCSH has restrictions because privacy coins are still controversial.

What Does This Mean for Other Privacy Coins?

Monero (XMR):

- Status: No ETF
- Challenge: Monero is 100% private by default (not optional like Zcash)
- Probability of ETF: Low in the short term
- Impact: If Zcash ETF is successful, Monero may be the next

Dash (DASH):

- Status: Has privacy features (PrivateSend)
- Probability of ETF: Medium
- Advantage: Privacy is optional, making it easier to regulate

Other:

- Beam, Grin, Firo: Too small for institutional ETFs in the current market

How to Invest

Option 1: Buy the ETF (ZCSH)

- Requirements: Be an accredited investor (earn $200K+ or have $1M+ in assets)
- Minimum: $25,000
- Account in a brokerage that offers Grayscale products

Advantages:

- Regulated and secure
- No need to hold a crypto wallet
- Simplified tax declaration

Disadvantages:

- 2.5% management fee per year
- Not "your" Zcash in reality
- High minimum

Option 2: Buy ZEC Directly

- Where to buy: <xchangeAffiliateLinks variant="default" />

Advantages:

- No minimum
- You control your keys
- Lower fees
- Can use private transactions

Disadvantages:

- Need to manage your wallet
- Risk of losing keys

Option 3: Wait for a Public ETF

- Possibility: Grayscale may convert ZCSH into a public ETF (like GBTC)

When: 2026-2027 (estimated)

Advantage: No minimum, available to everyone

Risks and Considerations

1. Regulatory Risk

Problem: The SEC may change its mind and force the ETF to close

History: It has happened with other crypto products

Mitigation: Grayscale has a good track record of navigating regulations

2. Delisting Risk

Problem: Exchanges may remove Zcash (like Coinbase did in some countries)

Impact: Reduced liquidity, price drops

3. Competition

Problem: Other privacy coins may surpass Zcash technologically

Example: Monero has stronger privacy features

4. Limited Adoption

Problem: Privacy coins have lower adoption than Bitcoin/Ethereum

Result: Less liquidity, more volatility

Expert Opinions

Hester Peirce (SEC):

"Auto-custody and financial privacy are fundamental rights consistent with the pro-liberty philosophy of the US."

Andreas Antonopoulos (Bitcoin Educator):

"Privacy is not about hiding crimes, it's about protecting rights. The Zcash ETF is a positive step."

Edward Snowden:

"Regulated privacy is better than no privacy, but it's not ideal. Use Monero if you want real privacy."

Frequently Asked Questions

1. Is Zcash legal?

Yes. Zcash is legal in the US and most countries. The Grayscale ETF confirms this.

2. Is Zcash used for crimes?

Rarely. Studies show that <% of Zcash transactions are illicit (vs 0.5% of Bitcoin).

3. Can I buy the ETF in Brazil?

No directly. ZCSH is only for accredited investors in the US. Brazilians can buy ZEC directly in exchanges.

4. Is it worth investing in Zcash?

Depends. If you believe in financial privacy and think privacy coins will grow, yes. If you're looking for returns, Bitcoin/Ethereum may be better.

5. Will Zcash surpass Monero?

Unlikely. Monero has a stronger community and more robust privacy features. But Zcash has regulatory advantages.

6. Will the ETF make Zcash go up?

Probably yes in the short term. Institutional demand tends to increase price. But long-term depends on adoption.

7. Should I buy ZEC or the ETF?

ZEC directly if you want real privacy and control.
ETF if you want convenience and are an accredited investor.

8. Will Monero have an ETF?

Difficult. Monero is more controversial than Zcash. But if ZCSH is successful, it may open the door.

9. Is Zcash better than Bitcoin?

For privacy, yes. For adoption, liquidity, and security, Bitcoin is still superior.

10. Is this good or bad for crypto?

Good. It shows that privacy can coexist with regulation. Opens doors for more innovation.

Conclusion: Progress with Caveats

The Grayscale Zcash ETF is a **historic milestone** for privacy coins, but comes with **trade-offs**:

Positive:

- ✅ Legitimization of privacy coins
- ✅ Institutional access to Zcash
- ✅ Precedent for other privacy coin ETFs
- ✅ Proof that privacy ≠ illegality

Negative:

- ❌ KYC required (government knows you have it)
- ❌ Centralized custody (not "your" ZEC)
- ❌ High minimum ($25K)
- ❌ High fees (2.5% per year)

Our opinion: It's a step in the right direction, but **true privacy still requires self-custody**. If you want maximum privacy, buy ZEC directly and use shielded transactions. If you want convenience and are an accredited investor, the ETF is an option.

The future: If ZCSH is successful, we may see ETFs for Monero, Dash, and other privacy coins. The battle between privacy and regulation is just beginning.
