The Aave is the largest decentralized lending protocol, allowing users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without intermediaries.

## What is Aave?

A protocol that connects:
- **Lenders**: Lend and earn interest
- **Borrowers**: Borrow and pay interest

## How Does It Work?

### Lending (Supply)
1. Deposit cryptocurrencies
2. Receive aTokens (e.g. aUSDC)
3. Earn interest automatically
4. Withdraw when desired

### Borrowing (Borrow)
1. Deposit collateral
2. Borrow up to 75% of the value
3. Pay variable or fixed interest
4. Return to release collateral

## Fees and Yields

**APY for Lenders:**
- Stablecoins: 2-8%
- ETH: 1-4%
- Altcoins: 0.5-15%

**APY for Borrowers:**
- Variable: 3-12%
- Stable: 5-15%

## Flash Loans

Instantaneous collateral-free loans:
- Borrow and repay in the same transaction
- Used for arbitrage
- Requires technical knowledge

## Risks

❌ Smart contract risk
❌ Liquidation if collateral falls
❌ High gas fees

## Conclusion

Aave is ideal for earning passive income or accessing liquidity without selling assets.
