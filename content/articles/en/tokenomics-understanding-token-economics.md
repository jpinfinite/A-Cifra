[Tokenomics](/artigo/tokenomics-entendiendo-la-economa-de-los-tokens "Tokenomics: Entendiendo la Economía de los Tokens") (Token + Economics) is the study of the economy of a token or cryptocurrency. Understanding tokenomics is essential to evaluate the potential of a crypto project.

## What is Tokenomics?

[Tokenomics](/artigo/tokenomics-economia-dos-tokens "Tokenomics: Entendendo a Economia dos Tokens") encompasses all the economic aspects of a token:

- Total and circulating supply
- Distribution and allocation
- Utility and use cases
- Burning and emission mechanisms
- Incentives and governance

## Key Elements

### 1. Supply

**Total Supply (Total Supply)**
- Maximum number of tokens that will exist
- Example: Bitcoin has 21 million

**Circulating Supply (Circulating Supply)**
- Tokens currently in circulation in the market
- Directly affects the price

**Maximum Supply (Max Supply)**
- Absolute limit of tokens
- Can be fixed or infinite

### 2. Distribution

How tokens are distributed:

**Public Sale (Public Sale)**
- ICO, IEO, IDO
- Available to general investors

**Team and Founders**
- Generally 10-20%
- With vesting period (gradual release)

**Private Investors**
- VCs and initial investors
- Also with vesting

**Treasury/Development**
- For project development
- Marketing and partnerships

**Community/Rewards**
- Staking, farming
- Usage incentives

### 3. Token Utility

Types of utility:

**Governance (Governance)**
- Right to vote in decisions
- Example: UNI (Uniswap)

**Utility (Utility)**
- Paying fees on the network
- Example: BNB (Binance)

**Security (Security)**
- Staking for validation
- Example: ETH (Ethereum 2.0)

**Store of Value (Store of Value)**
- Protection against inflation
- Example: BTC (Bitcoin)

### 4. Economic Mechanisms

Burning tokens (Burn)
- Reduces circulating supply
- Can increase value
- Example: BNB quarterly burn

Emission/Inflation
- New tokens created
- Mining/staking rewards
- Can dilute value

Vesting
- Gradual release of tokens
- Prevents massive dump
- Aligns long-term incentives

## How to Analyze Tokenomics

### Analysis Checklist:

1. **Is the supply reasonable?**
   - High supply may hinder price appreciation
   - Low supply may limit adoption

2. **Is the distribution fair?**
   - Team has less than 20%?
   - Is there adequate vesting?
   - Does the community have significant participation?

3. **Does the token have real utility?**
   - Does it solve a problem?
   - Is it necessary to use the protocol?
   - Is there organic demand?

4. **Are there deflationary mechanisms?**
   - Is there token burning?
   - Supply decreases over time?

5. **Are incentives aligned?**
   - Team has long-term interest?
   - Holders are rewarded?

## Red Flags

❌ **Concentrated Distribution**
- Team/founders with >30%
- Few holders control the majority

❌ **Lack of Clear Utility**
- Token serves no purpose
- Only speculation

❌ **Excessive Inflation**
- Uncontrolled emission
- No burning mechanism

❌ **Short or Non-Existent Vesting**
- Team can sell quickly
- High risk of dump

## Practical Examples

### Bitcoin (BTC)
- ✅ Fixed supply: 21 million
- ✅ Decentralized distribution
- ✅ Utility: store of value
- ✅ Deflationary: halvings

### Ethereum (ETH)
- ✅ Utility: gas fees, staking
- ✅ Token burning (EIP-1559)
- ✅ Multiple use cases
- ⚠️ Unlimited supply

## Conclusion

Solid [tokenomics](/artigo/tokenomics-how-to-evaluate-the-economy-of-a-token "Tokenomics: How to Evaluate the Economy of a Token") are essential for long-term project success. Before investing:

1. Study the documentation (whitepaper)
2. Analyze the distribution
3. Verify real utility
4. Compare with similar projects
5. Evaluate economic mechanisms

Remember: good tokenomics do not guarantee success, but bad tokenomics almost always lead to failure.
