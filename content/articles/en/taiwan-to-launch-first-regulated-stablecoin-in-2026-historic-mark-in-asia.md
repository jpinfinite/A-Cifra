In a move that could redefine the landscape of stablecoins in Asia, **[Taiwan](/artigo/taiwan-stablecoin-regulada-2026-primeira-oficial "Taiwan Lançará Primeira Stablecoin Regulada em 2026: Marco Histórico na Ásia") has officially announced** the launch of its **first regulated stablecoin** for the second quarter of 2026. The initiative, led by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) of Taiwan in partnership with local banks and technology companies, marks a **historic precedent** in the region and could accelerate the adoption of regulated cryptocurrencies across Asia.

## Official Announcement

**Backing:** 100% in Taiwanese dollars (TWD)
**Regulator:** Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
**Partners:** Bank of Taiwan, Cathay United Bank, Fubon Bank
**Technology:** Hybrid blockchain (public + private)

**Key Features:**
- **1:1 parity** with the Taiwanese dollar (TWD)
- **Monthly audit** by independent firms
- **100% reserves** in regulated banks
- **KYC/AML mandatory** for all users

### Implementation Schedule

**Q4 2025 (current):**
- Public consultation on regulatory framework
- Selection of technology partners
- Definition of technical standards

**Q1 2026:**

- Testing with financial institutions

- Integration with Taiwanese exchanges
- Availability to the general public

**Q3-Q4 2026:**
- Expansion to commercial payments
- Integration with payment systems
- Evaluation of international expansion

## Why is Taiwan Doing This?

### 1. Geopolitical Competition

**Asian Context:**
- **China:** Digital yuan (e-CNY) already in use since 2020
- **Japan:** Testing digital yen since 2023
- **South Korea:** Digital won in pilot phase
- **Singapore:** Project Ubin advanced
- **Hong Kong:** e-HKD in development

**Taiwan's Position:**
- Cannot fall behind in the digital race
- Needs to maintain financial competitiveness
- Opportunity to differentiate from China

### 2. Financial Innovation

**Declared Objectives:**
- Modernize the financial system
- Reduce transaction costs
- Facilitate cross-border payments
- Attract fintech companies
- Position Taiwan as the crypto hub of Asia

**Expected Benefits:**
- Instant transactions 24/7
- 80% lower costs than bank transfers
- Financial inclusion (2 million without bank accounts)
- Transparency and traceability

### 3. Market Demand

**Taiwanese Statistics:**
- **5.2 million** Taiwanese possess crypto (22% of the population)
- **$8.5 billion** in monthly trading volume
- **15 exchanges** registered locally
- **$2.1 billion** in circulating stablecoins

**Current Problem:**
- Unregulated stablecoins (USDT, USDC)
- Risk of depegging
- Lack of consumer protection
- Difficulty integrating with traditional banking

**Solution:** Regulated stablecoin

## Stablecoin vs CBDC: What's the Difference?

### Technical Comparison

| Feature | Regulated Stablecoin (TWDS) | CBDC (Digital Yuan) |
|----------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Issuer** | Regulated private banks | Central Bank |
| **Backing** | Bank reserves | Central bank liability |
| **Blockchain** | Public/Hybrid | Private |
| **Programmability** | Yes (smart contracts) | Limited |
| **Privacy** | Moderate (KYC) | Low (traceable) |
| **Decentralization** | Partial | Centralized |
| **Interoperability** | High | Low |
| **Crypto Adoption** | Facilitated | Restricted |

### Why Stablecoin and Not CBDC?

**Advantages of Taiwan's Approach:**

**1. Flexibility:**
- Can use public blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon)
- Interoperable with DeFi protocols

**2. Innovation:**

- Diverse use cases

**3. Privacy:**
- Less tracking than CBDC
- Balance between privacy and compliance
- Not a tool for state control

**4. Adoption:**
- Compatible with existing crypto wallets
- Can be listed on exchanges
- Facilitates on/off ramp

**5. Cost:**
- Less expensive infrastructure
- Does not require a new system
- Leverages existing blockchain
