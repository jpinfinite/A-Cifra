The 2025-2026 scenario is marked by a concentration of cyber attacks and scams, making cryptographic security more important than ever.

**The Importance of a Multisig Wallet**

In this context, a multisig wallet becomes an essential tool to protect your digital assets. A multisig wallet is a wallet that requires the signature of at least two users to perform transactions, significantly reducing the risk of money and data loss. With a multisig wallet, you can share the responsibility of managing your assets with other users, making it more difficult for a single individual to access and transfer your assets.

This means that, to perform a transaction, it is necessary that at least one of the approver users is present and agrees with the transaction.

The multisig wallet works as follows:

1. Each approver user receives a private key associated with the wallet.
2. When a user wants to perform a transaction, they need to obtain the signature of at least one of the approver users.
3. The signature is obtained through the digital signature of the private key of the approver user.
4. The transaction is then sent to the [blockchain](/artigo/how-to-read-a-blockchain-on-chain-analysis-guide-for-beginners "How to Read a Blockchain: On-Chain Analysis Guide for Beginners") network, where it is verified and validated.

**Market Analysis and Potential Appreciation**
