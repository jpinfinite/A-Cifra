Bitcoin Cycles: What to Expect from the 2028 Halving?

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that has already completed over a decade of existence, and throughout these years, it has passed through various cycles of valuation and devaluation. One of the main factors that influence these cycles is the Halving, an event that occurs every 4 years, reducing the reward for mining in half.

What is the Halving and How Does it Work?

The Halving is a mechanism of inflation control implemented in the Bitcoin protocol, which aims to maintain a stable supply of money and prevent the creation of excessive new units. When a new block is added to the blockchain, miners receive a reward in the form of Bitcoin, which is calculated based on the complexity of the mining algorithm.

Every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every 4 years, the reward for mining is reduced by half. This means that miners must work harder to obtain the same amount of Bitcoin, increasing the difficulty of mining and, consequently, the security of the network.

Why is the Halving Important?

The Halving is important because it helps to maintain a stable supply of Bitcoin and prevent the creation of excessive new units. This is essential to maintain investor confidence and market stability. Additionally, the Halving also helps to increase the difficulty of mining, which is fundamental to the security of the network.
