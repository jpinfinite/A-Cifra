The Shiba Inu (SHIB) emerged in 2020 as an alternative to Dogecoin, but evolved into much more than a simple meme coin.

## The History of SHIB

Created anonymously by "Ryoshi" in August 2020, the SHIB presented itself as the "Dogecoin Killer".

**Initial Launch:**
- 50% of the supply sent to Vitalik Buterin
- 50% locked in liquidity on Uniswap
- Vitalik burned 90% and donated 10% to charity

## The Shiba Inu Ecosystem

### 1. Ecosystem Tokens

**SHIB**: Main token
- Supply: 1 quadrillion (many already burned)
- Used for transactions and staking

**LEASH**: Reward token
- Limited supply: 107,646
- Higher value per token

**BONE**: Governance token
- Used for voting
- Staking rewards

### 2. ShibaSwap (DEX)

Decentralized exchange of the ecosystem:

- Staking (DIG)
- Farming (BURY)

### 3. Shibarium (Layer 2)
