[Layer](/artigo/layer-3-y-superchains-2026-la-prxima-evolucin-de-la-escalabilidad-blockchain "Layer 3 y Superchains 2026: La Próxima Evolución de la Escalabilidad Blockchain") 3 and Superchains: The Next Evolution of Blockchain Scalability

If you thought [Layer](/artigo/layer-3-superchains-2026 "Layer 3 e Superchains 2026: A Próxima Evolução da Escalabilidade Blockchain") 2 was the end of blockchain scalability evolution, get ready. Layer 3 and Superchains are coming in 2026, promising millions of transactions per second, centavo costs, and applications that were previously impossible.

What are Layer 3?

Understanding the Layered Architecture

**Layer 1 (Ethereum, Bitcoin):**
- Blockchain base
- Maximum security and decentralization
- Slow and expensive
- ~15 TPS, $1-50 per transaction

**Layer 2 (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base):**
- Built on L1
- Inherits L1 security
- Faster and cheaper
- ~2,000-4,000 TPS, $0.01-0.50 per transaction

**Layer 3 (New in 2026):**
- Built on L2
- Inherits L2 security (which inherits from L1)
- Extremely fast and cheap
- ~100,000+ TPS, $0.0001-0.01 per transaction

Why Do We Need Layer 3?

Limitations of Layer 2:
- Still expensive for microtransactions
- Not optimized for specific cases
- Limited interoperability
- Restricted customization

Layer 3 resolves:
- Hiperespecialization: Each L3 optimized for a use case
- Extremely low costs: Centavo costs for thousands of transactions
- Massive throughput: Millions of TPS
- Total customization: Custom rules for consensus, gas, etc.

Layer 3 Architectures in 2026

1. Rollups over Rollups

Concept:
A rollup (L3) posts its data to another rollup (L2), which posts to Ethereum (L1).

Example:
```
Ethereum (L1)
  ↓
Arbitrum (L2)
  ↓
Xai Gaming Chain (L3)
```

Advantages:
- Inherits Ethereum security
- 100-1000x lower costs than L2
- Fast finality (seconds)
- Customization for gaming

Use cases:
- Blockchain games
- Social networks on-chain
- Microtransactions
- IoT and payments

2. Validiums and Volitions

Validium:
- Data stored off-chain
- Proofs of validity on-chain
- Cheaper, less secure

Volition:
- User chooses: data on-chain or off-chain
- Maximum flexibility
- Tradeoff security vs cost

Example:
StarkEx offers both modes for NFTs and trading.

3. App-Specific Rollups

Concept:
Each application has its own L3 optimized for it.

Examples:

dYdX v4:
- L3 dedicated for trading
- Optimized for orderbook
- Ultra-low latency
- Massive throughput

Immutable X:
- L3 for NFTs and gaming
- Zero gas for users
- Instant mint and trade

Lyra Finance:
- L3 for options
- Real-time pricing
- Instant liquidation
