After three years banned from the world's major financial stage, [Polymarket](/artigo/polymarket-makes-bad-bets-to-return-to-the-us-billion-dollar-bet-could-change-the-game-for-predictio "Polymarket Makes Bad Bets to Return to the US: Billion-Dollar Bet Could Change the Game for Prediction Markets"), the crypto prediction giant, is ready to reopen its doors in the United States. The highly anticipated return, backed by regulatory approval and massive investments, could shake up the US prediction market scene.

## Quick Summary

- **Expected Return**: By November 2025, with an initial focus on sports betting
- **CFTC Green Light**: A no-action letter issued after acquiring the regulated QCEX
- **Evaluations Soaring**: The company could reach $10 billion, up from $1 billion in June
- **Heavyweight Investors**: ICE (NYSE owner) invested $2 billion in the platform

## From Exile to Comeback: How Polymarket Turned the Game

In 2022, the CFTC forced [Polymarket](/artigo/polymarket-makes-bad-bets-to-return-to-the-us-billion-dollar-bet-could-change-the-game-of-prediction "Polymarket Makes Bad Bets to Return to the US: Billion-Dollar Bet Could Change the Game of Prediction Markets") out of the US for operating derivatives without registration. Three years later, the scene has changed completely.

### Regulatory Turnaround

In September 2024, the Commission issued a no-action letter after [Polymarket](/artigo/polymarket-hace-las-malas-para-regresar-a-los-eua-apuesta-billonaria-puede-cambiar-el-juego-de-los-m "Polymarket Hace las Malas para Regresar a los EUA: Apuesta Billonaria Puede Cambiar el Juego de los Mercados de Predicción") acquired QCEX, a regulated derivatives exchange. This was the missing piece for the triumphant return.

Polymarket's founder, Shayne Coplan, took advantage of the moment to set up the necessary legal infrastructure. As a result, the platform now displays a waiting list and the "coming soon for American traders" notice on its website.

### Calculated Return Strategy

The return will be gradual and cautious:

**Phase 1: Sports Betting**
- A gateway to test the waters
- Demonstrate regulatory maturity
- Build confidence with authorities

**Phase 2: POLY Token (2026)**
- Launch only after consolidation
- Avoid regulatory setbacks
- Ensure a solid user base

Everything is calculated to avoid past mistakes and consolidate a sustainable foothold.

## Meteoric Growth: Polymarket's New Era Numbers

### Evaluation Evolution

- **June 2024**: $1 billion (after a $200 million funding round)
- **September 2024**: $8 billion (with ICE's $2 billion investment)
- **Potential 2025**: Up to $10 billion

### ICE's Historic Investment

The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), owner of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), invested an impressive $2 billion in Polymarket, valuing the company at $8 billion.

Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE CEO, summarized the partnership:

"It's the union of an institution founded in 1792 with a visionary DeFi company."

- Moved over $2 billion per month
